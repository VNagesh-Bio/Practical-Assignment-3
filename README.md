# Practical-Assignment-3

## Executive summary
This is a practical exercise to complete the requirements for the Certificate in AI/ML at UC Berkeley. The goals is to compare the performance of different model classifiers (K Nearest Neighbor, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees and Support Vector Machines. The data set used is a dataset from the UCI Machine learning repository. The data is from a institution to determine if the client is likely to subscribe to a term deposit

## Rationale
The understanding of the best model to predict the churn of the marketing campaign can help the optimization of the marketing workflow of the company. This can help targeting the right client that is more likely to accept the subscription a turn deposit

## Research Question
Which model from K Nearest Neighbor, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, or Support Vector Machine is the most accurate in the test data set, using their default parameters?

After optimization of the two best models in their default parameters, which one have better performance?

What are the most important features in the determination if the client has subscribed to a term deposit?
